# todo-ssr
> A progressively enhanced to-do web application.

* Single Page Application (SPA) to avoid page refreshes.
* Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for progressive enhancement.
* Server-side form validation for less redundancy.

Note: Normally, a project like this would be split into separate repositories; one for the client and one for the server. For educational purposes, both are combined here.


## Installation

Be sure that [Git](https://git-scm.com) `>= 2` is installed.

Open a command line at, or change directory (`cd`) to where you'd like the project to exist (as a sub-directory).

Checkout the repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:stevenvachon/todo-ssr.git
```

Open the project directory:
```shell
cd todo-ssr
```

Refer to the READMEs in `client/` and `server/` for the remaining instructions.
